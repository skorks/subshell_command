# SubshellCommand

If, like me, you always forget when and how (and why) to use backticks or popen or whatever when trying to execute a shell command from within a ruby process, this should hopefully make life a little bit easier.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'subshell_command'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install subshell_command

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
